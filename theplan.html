        <p>
          So this is a list of your content, sans images. Obviously image display is the focus of my programming goals with this site, but I'm just making sure you're down with the organization of your current content. Below is a list of the pages, which will obviously be seperate pages. I just put them all on this homepage for your reference. I copied and pasted your copy, aka text in here to give us some bearings. <span>The text in red</span> is directed at you! Aka if you could respond to that stuff, it would be really helpful. Anywho, we really ought to meet up sometime and get some of this down- we can basically do a code-along, except you'll just be telling me how you want it to look and I'll modify the code accordigly. I can also get the image files from you directly, which will probably be easiest.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact Page</h2>
        <p>
          WILL COPY INFO HERE. <span>Do you want the info page to be the home page for your site? Or do you want something different for home? Maybe a sampling of various images and a short header with text like "My name is Janice, welcome to my world!" or something haha. Just a thought.</span> And of course clicking the banner will take users home. If you want a link to home in the navbar(which will be on every page, naturally), <span>just let me know</span>- it's just not very commmonplace to have that anymore.
        </p>


        <h2>Projects Page</h2>
        <ol>
          <li> PAGE DESCRIPTION: Project page will have links to individual pages. I was thinking they could be displayed in a preview form on this page with horizontal bars that span across the whole page (very mobile friendly).
          </li>
          <li>
            Mandala Endangered Species Conservation Park (15 images)<br>
            My thesis project (currently in progress) is the development of a fictional zoo/theme park that I have entitled Mandala, the sanskrit word for unity. The goal of the park is to aid in the survival of threatened and endangered species through research, developing captive breeding programs, and releasing the offspring into protected areas in the wild. Additionally, the park aims to educate future generations about the importance of sustainability, biodiversity, and respecting the environment by providing a fun and engaging guest experience with attractions that entertain as well as educate.

            This project is on-going and will be frequently updated throughout the remainder of my final semester at Ringling.<span>Need to update copy!!!</span>

            Match-a-Saurus (2 Images) <br>
            Illustrations for a children's matching card game featuring different types of dinosaurs. Backgrounds and reverse side design created in collaboration with Bree Lundberg, who also illustrated six additional dinosaurs to complete a 12 card matching set.
            <span>Janice, we recently made a matching card game in Javascript in class. Did this ever get produced? I don't want to step on any toes but if i could get all 12 individual image files from you I could easily make a page with a functioning in-browser matching game... Might be kinda cool.</span>

        <h2>Illustrations Page</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>PAGE DESCRIPTION: This is a page of one off images. Obviously, I think it can be more of splash screen with all of the images displayed together and then the user can click them to see them all together. <span>Thoughts?</span></li>
